[8] September 2010 - August 2013: Counting Assembly Pathway by Using Permutation Group Action (Master Thesis) <br>
Counting physical and chemical structures by group action returns to George Polya’s work in the first half of twentieth century. Later, mathematicians such as Kerber and Fripertinger continued the pioneering work of Polya by improving Polya’s celebration theorem. In this project, we review the George Polya’s works and then compute the number of orbits of a given group on a collection of assembly trees. Furthermore, the automorphism group of various classes of fullerenes and D5 networks have been obtained. By using these calculations and a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10440-009-9503-8">paper</a> of <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/MRAuthorID/197410">Darafsheh</a>, we have computed some distance-based graph invariants of fullerene graphs and D5 networks.
